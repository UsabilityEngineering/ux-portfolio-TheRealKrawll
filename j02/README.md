# The Keureg K-Cafe Experience

# The Unboxing

I've had a keureg for a few years now. Wife got it for me for Christmas in 2018 and I have used it nearly every single day. Lately, I haven't been using it as much because I've been drinking Chia Tea Lattes recently. Specifically using Chia tea from Chico Chai (The best I have ever had). A friend of mine mentioned that he got his girlfriend a keureg that could make lattes and I went on the hunt. After doing some research, it looks like the one he mentions was the best one for the price. My wife baught it for me the very next day.

* Turn off the AUTO OFF
* Make a regular coffee
* Make a chai tea latte (with k-cup)

# Making A Coffee

After cleaning the machine, I powered it on. There was no noise to indicate it was on but there was a backlight on the power button. From my experience using my old keureg, I knew that it would take a some time to heat up the water before it would indicate that it is ready to use. Sure enough, that is exactly what happened.

Onoe it was ready then the "COFFEE", "LATTE & CAPP", and "STRONG" button were on. It wasn't until this point that I saw the AUTO OFF indicator. I can clearly tell what it does but turning it off was a mystery. There is no button clearly marked for this and but my other keureg had a button. The only thing I can think of is a long press of the power button. Sure enough, it did exaclty as I thought. 

Now I want to make a regular cup of coffee like I usually do. The problem is, I don't actually know how much coffee my other keureg made using the large icon (the one I commonly use). I had to test it out with my old keureg and it looks like it is really close to 10oz. Next I filled up the water resevior which was very straight forward. Then lifted the top, which has a litle tab in the front, just like my older keureg, put my k-cup in, and closed it. Now the icons that were on, started blinking. Again, this is how my older keureg worked.

Since I want to make a regular coffee at 10oz, I selected the coffee button and then the coffee button lit up solid and the ammounts started blinking. So, I selected the 10oz button then the center icon (that looks like a K) started blinking. Once I pressed the K, you could hear the machine start to purr. I feel like the keureg is doing a great job leading you to your next options. My older keureg had a power button, a sleep button, and 3 size buttons. It was much simpler but don't feel this one add any more difficulty of use, just more steps. The coffee was great!

# Making A Chae Tea Latte

Making a Chai tea latte on a keureg is a new experience to me but I have a feeling that I could do it without any instructions or external assistance.
