# Nick's UX Portfolio

![Me and Lily](/assets/me.jpg)

My name is Nicholas Shaddox. This is my User Experience Portfolio. I like programming, making and playing video games, drinking...coffee and chai tea lattes, and eating ramen. I am currently an senior undergraduate in computer science and most likely going into the masters program in fall of 2023.
