# Nick's UX Portfolio

My name is Nicholas Shaddox. This is my User Experience Portfolio. I like programming, making and playing video games, drinking...coffee and chai tea lattes, and eating ramen. I am currently an senior undergraduate in computer science and working as a DevOps apprentice in the spring of 2023.
